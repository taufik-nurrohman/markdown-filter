PHP Markdown Filter
===================

Motivation
----------

As [Markdown](https://github.com/taufik-nurrohman/markdown) has grown in popularity, many people have expected to see
new formatting syntaxes added. However, people who develop Markdown parsers will generally stick to the philosophy that
[John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) has explained, that the design goal of Markdownâ€™s formatting
syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable
as-is, as plain text, without looking like itâ€™s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

Typically, they will simply tell people to use raw HTML syntax if their wishes are too complex and/or not in line with
Markdownâ€™s philosophy. Markdown parser generally does not prohibit people from doing so.

Etc... etc...

Usage
-----

This converter can be installed using [Composer](https://packagist.org/packages/taufik-nurrohman/markdown-filter), but
it doesnâ€™t need any other dependencies and just uses Composerâ€™s ability to automatically include files. Those of you who
donâ€™t use Composer should be able to include the `index.php` file directly into your application without any problems.

### Using Composer

From the command line interface, navigate to your project folder then run this command:

~~~ sh
composer require taufik-nurrohman/markdown-filter
~~~

Require the generated auto-loader file in your application:

~~~ php
<?php

use function x\markdown_filter\row as filter_row;
use function x\markdown_filter\rows as filter_rows;

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$content = file_get_contents('.\path\to\file.md');

$content = filter_rows($content, function ($chunk, $status) {
    if (0 === $status || 2 === $status) {
        return $chunk;
    }
    return filter_row($row, function ($chunk, $status) {
        if (0 === $status) {
            return $chunk;
        }
        // Safely convert `~~asdf~~` syntax to `<del>asdf</del>`
        return preg_replace('/~~([^\n]+)~~/', '<del>$1</del>', $chunk);
    });
});

// You can now convert the Markdown string to HTML string using your preferred Markdown converter
echo (new ParsedownExtra)->text($content);
~~~

### Using File

Require the `index.php` file in your application:

~~~ php
<?php

use function x\markdown_filter\row as filter_row;
use function x\markdown_filter\rows as filter_rows;

require 'index.php';

$content = file_get_contents('.\path\to\file.md');

$content = filter_rows($content, function ($chunk, $status) {
    if (0 === $status || 2 === $status) {
        return $chunk;
    }
    return filter_row($row, function ($chunk, $status) {
        if (0 === $status) {
            return $chunk;
        }
        // Safely convert `~~asdf~~` syntax to `<del>asdf</del>`
        return preg_replace('/~~([^\n]+)~~/', '<del>$1</del>', $chunk);
    });
});

// You can now convert the Markdown string to HTML string using your preferred Markdown converter
echo (new ParsedownExtra)->text($content);
~~~
