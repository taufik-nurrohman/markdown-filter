Currently, I don’t really care about Markdown’s lazy block syntax because the main purpose of this tokenizer is only to
mark blocks that can be used as a place for the “embed” syntax. So, Markdown syntax like “lazy block quote” and “lazy
block list” will likely appear inconsistent in the situation below. Don’t worry, my Markdown parser will do the
tokenization better after this. My main focus for now is just to keep it fast and simple.
